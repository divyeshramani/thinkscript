# Scans 

Thikorswim custom scans script to find the stocks in play. 



## Rising-MFI-Scans

Theory: When stocks hit bottom and then MoneyFlowIndex started rising, but price is not yet moving up fast enough yet or going sideways or down, that creates divergence. Stock price should follow MoneyFlowIndex eventually. 

Scans parameters: 
```
length = 15;
minimmum_mfi_change = 35;
multiplier = 7;
```

Find stocks with current MFI value increased at least by  minimmum_mfi_change(35) from the lowest value in last length(15) days, and current stock value is not increased more than 5% (35/7) from lowest of the period.
